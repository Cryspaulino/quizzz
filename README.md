## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Learn TypeScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpwzRDUQ1GI)
* [TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [I still want to learn more about how the basic drawing app works, how to accept drawings in Typescript]
* [I added this but changing the score so it doesn't always give 100% right but subtracts the questions you got wrong]
* [ Something that would be useful is actually using a json file so the questions added by the user stay in the instances of the Question class, however, this is not a priority because i could still add them in the questions.ts file]
